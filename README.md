# Diamond-Price-Inference-A-Bayesian-Approach
DATS6450 - Bayesian Statistics at The George Washington University - CCAS: Data Science Department - End of Semester Final Project. 

This is a repository for a Bayesian Generalized Linear Model (GLM) approach and validated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Simulation to ensure the approach was sound and validated. This project is for the Bayesian Statistics Elective at The George Washington University, Master of Science in Data Science. All code is on the .ipynb as well as the .r file(s). 

Download these notebooks or clone the repository for full reproduction of the results. Additionally there are additional webscraped data sets that you can utilize in order to learn how to utilize the various models. The repository holds the project report, project website, webscraped data, code files and other documents.

Good luck pricing diamonds!
